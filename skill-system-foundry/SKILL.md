# Skill System Foundry

A meta-skill for constructing and evolving AI-agnostic skill systems.

This skill governs the creation and maintenance of a two-layer architecture: **skills** (with optional capabilities) and **roles**. All skills produced by this skill system follow the Agent Skills open specification (see [`references/agentskills-spec.md`](references/agentskills-spec.md)), incorporate best practices consolidated from official vendor skill authoring guides (see [`references/authoring-principles.md`](references/authoring-principles.md)), and align role contracts with the local convention guidance in [`references/tool-integration.md`](references/tool-integration.md#convention-coexistence).

**Important:** Capabilities are optional, granular sub-skills within a parent skill. Do not create capabilities by default. Only introduce them when the integrator explicitly asks for them or when the domain clearly demands decomposition (3+ distinct operations with different trigger contexts). Start with a standalone skill; evolve to router+capabilities only when justified.

## Architecture Overview

The skill system follows a strict two-layer architecture — **skills** and **roles**. Dependencies flow strictly downward — never the reverse. A capability must never know it's being orchestrated. A role references skills but never other roles.

The dependency direction governs **references between layers**, not where orchestration begins. Two valid orchestration paths exist:

```
Path 1:  orchestration skill → roles → skills (with optional capabilities)
Path 2:  skill (standalone or router) → role(s) → skill's capabilities
```

- **Path 1 — Coordination-only skill.** A lean standalone skill sequences roles across domains. Contains no domain logic.
- **Path 2 — Self-contained skill.** A domain skill loads one or more roles for interactive workflow logic. The skill owns capabilities; roles provide responsibility, authority, and constraints, plus handoff rules, sequencing, and interaction patterns.

See [`references/architecture-patterns.md`](references/architecture-patterns.md#orchestration-skills) for decision checklists and constraints per path.

Each layer has a clear responsibility:

- **Skills** — Canonical, AI-agnostic knowledge and logic. Conform to the Agent Skills specification. A skill handles a task directly (standalone) or optionally routes to capabilities for complex domains that warrant decomposition.
- **Roles** — Canonical, AI-agnostic orchestration contracts. A role defines responsibility, authority, and constraints, plus handoff rules and workflow sequencing while composing multiple skills/capabilities.

## Core Principles

### 1. Agent Skills Specification Compliance

All skills must conform to the Agent Skills specification (agentskills.io). Every registered skill directory contains a `SKILL.md` with valid YAML frontmatter. The `name` field matches the parent directory name, lowercase + hyphens only, max 64 chars. The `description` field is max 1024 chars, third-person, and describes both what the skill does and when to trigger it.

Note: capabilities are discovery-internal sub-skills. Their entry point is `capability.md`. Capability frontmatter is optional (use it when portability/promotion to standalone is likely).

Progressive disclosure is respected at all levels:
- **Level 1: Metadata** (~100 tokens) — name + description, always in context
- **Level 2: Instructions** (<5000 tokens / recommended max 500 lines) — loaded when triggered
- **Level 3: Resources** (unlimited) — scripts, references, assets, on demand

### 2. Token Economy

Discovery tokens are always present and expensive. Execution tokens are only paid when activated. Register one skill per domain, not one per capability. Keep router SKILL.md files lean. Push detail into capabilities or references. Prefer a standalone skill until the domain justifies capabilities.

### 3. Conciseness

The model is already smart. Only add context it doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: "Does the model really need this explanation?" See [`references/authoring-principles.md`](references/authoring-principles.md) for detailed guidance.

### 4. Degrees of Freedom

Match specificity to the task's fragility. High freedom for flexible tasks, low freedom for fragile operations. See [`references/authoring-principles.md`](references/authoring-principles.md).

### 5. Write Once, Adapt Everywhere

Domain knowledge is authored exactly once in the canonical layer (skills and roles). When domain knowledge changes, one file changes. Tool-specific deployment pointers, if needed, are optional user-managed customizations documented in [`references/tool-integration.md`](references/tool-integration.md).
